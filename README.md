## Week 1 Assignment - Calculator with Rails
Yes, this is way overkill to use Rails to build a simple calculator. This is not an exercise to see if you can build a calculator, it's intended to make you use some of the controller and view so that you begin to understand where everything goes and the request-response cycle in Rails.

Build a calculator that 
- has the numbers 1-9 as separate buttons
- supports addition and subtraction
- Has the user entering things in the format "1 + 1 =" using buttons

Please do not just use some Javascript to solve the problem in a single page. Though, you may need to use a little Javascript to get some field assignments to work properly.

## Week 2 - Scaffolding and Persistence
- Scaffolding basics
- Routes and REST
- Testing in Rails
- ActiveRecord and Models

## Week 2 Assignment - Company Employee Listing
Looking for an applivation that allows the user to manage the employees for many companies. Want to be able to do the following
- View and manage a list of companies
- View and manage the employees for each of those companies
- see the count of employees for each company
- search for employees matching a portion of a name

Scaffolding will create a lot of this for you, but it won't be pretty, so you may want to add a little style to the generated pages. Don't worry about pagination right now. Active Record does have capabilities to help with that, though. You will need to create your own content for the search page.
